## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I've learned how to use 'forEach' loop for arrays to get all the buttons and apllied different states based on user clicks.

I've also learned how to display a popup message after the user presses the Submit button to submit the rating.

I've refreshed my knowledge about the switch statement and some CSS and HTML features.

### Continued development

In the future I will continue expand my JavaScript knowledge by building some cool projects.
